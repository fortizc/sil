# SIL
This is a very **S**imple **I**mage **L**ibrary written in C to load and write images. It includes support for some Netpbm formats in binary mode like [PPM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) and [PGM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html).

Others features like filters maybe can be included as a separate repository in the near future. The idea is keep SIL as simple as possible.
